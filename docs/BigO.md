## What is Big O Notation?
A method of notation for classifying how scalable an algorithm or function is. It allows us to estimate the worst case run time of an algorithm or how long it take for the algorithm to complete based on the input side.

_In short what Big O tells us is..._
> How much slower an algorithm will run as it's input size grows.
